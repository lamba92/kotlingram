# Telegram bot API for Kotlin

Looking for a Kotlin first Telegram APIs? You are in the right place! This project offers Kotlin/Multiplatform APIs for
Telegram bots based on Kotlinx.serialization and Ktor client and coroutines.

The APIs are generated by parsing the official Telegram documentation. For sure there are errors since no testing is in
place, but message retrieval works!

# Usage

Add a Ktor Client engine for your [platform of choice](https://ktor.io/docs/http-client-engines.html) in your Gradle
build, then simply:

```kotlin
val client = TelegramBotApiClient("botToken")
val user: TelegramResponse<User> = client.getMe()
val user: TelegramResponse<List<Update>> = client.getUpdates()
```

I did not yet published the libraries on Maven Central
